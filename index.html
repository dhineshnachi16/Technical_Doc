                <h3>What is C++?</h3>
                <p>C++ is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
                possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA).[17]
                meaning that compiled c++ code can run on all platforms that support c++ without the need for recompilation.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                The "Hello World" program is the first step towards learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn.
                All you have to do is display the message "Hello World" on the screen.</p>
                <p> Let us now look at the program:
                <br>
                <div id="code">public class HelloWorldApp <br>
                public static void main(String[] args) { <br>
                system.outprintln("Hello World")) <br>
                } </div></p>
                </div>
                <div id="obj">
                C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language. <br>
                The main pillars of Object Oriented Programming are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="inheritance">
                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her
                    parents. With inheritance, reusability is a major advantage. You can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. In c++, there are
                    various types of inheritances: single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid. For example, Apple is a fruit so assume that we have a
                    class Fruit and a subclass of it named Apple. Our Apple acquires the properties of the Fruit class. Other classifications could be grape, pear,
                    and mango, etc. Fruit defines a class of foods that are mature ovaries of a plant, fleshy, contains a large seed within or numerous tiny seeds.
                    Apple the sub-class acquires these properties from Fruit and has some unique properties, which are different from other sub-classes of Fruit
                    such as red, round, depression at the top.
                </p>
                <h5>Mode of Inheritance:</h5>
                <p>
                <strong> Public Mode:</strong> If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived
                class and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.</p>
                <p><strong>Protected Mode:</strong> If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class
                will harome protected in derived place </p>
                <p><strong>Private Mode:</strong> If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will
                become Private in derived class.</p>
                <h5>Types of Inheritance in c++ :</h5>
                <p>
                <strong> Single Inheritance:</strong> In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class. i.e. one sub class is inherited by one base class
                only.    
                <p><strong>Multiple Inheritance:</strong> Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes. I.e one sub class is
                inherited from more than one base classes.</p>
                <p><strong>Multilevel Inheritance:</strong> In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class. </p>
                <p><strong>Hieratical Inheritance:</strong> In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited from a single base class i.e. more than one derived
                class is created from a single base class. </p>
                <p><strong>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:</strong> Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. For example: Combining
                Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
                    </p>    
            </div>
            <div id="Polymorphism">
                <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
                <p>Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. This being said, each child sub-
                class keeps its own functions/methods as they are. If we had a superclass called Mammal that has a method called mammalSound(). The sub-
                classes of Mammals could be Dogs, whales, elephants, and horses. Each of these would have their own iteration of a mammal sound (dog-
                barks, whale-clicks). <br>
                <b>In c++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</b><ol>
                    <li>Compile time Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
                </ol>
                Compile time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. <br>
                Runtime polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Abstraction">
                <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                <p>
                    Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the
                    object.
                    Suppose you want to create a dating application and you are asked to collect all the information about your users. You might receive the
                    following data from your user: Full name, address, phone number, favorite food, favorite movie, hobbies, tax information, social security
                    number, credit score. This amount of data is great however not all of it is required to create a dating profile. You only need to select the
                    information that is pertinent to your dating application from that pool. Data like Full name, favorite food, favorite movie, and hobbies make
                    sense for a dating application. The process of fetching/removing/selecting the user information from a larger pool is referred to as Abstraction.
                    One of the advantages of Abstraction is being able to apply the same information you used for the dating application to other applications with
                    little or no modification.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Abstraction using Classes:</strong> We can implement Abstraction in c++ using classes. Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not. <br>
                    <strong>Abstraction in Header files:</strong> One more type of abstraction in c++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in
                    math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and
                    pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating power of
                    numbers.
                    </p>
                    
                    Advantages of Data Abstraction:<ol>
                        <li>Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code</li>
                        <li>Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.</li>
                        <li>Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.</li>
                        <li>Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.</li>
                    </ol>
            </div>
            <div id="Encapsulation">
                <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
                <p>In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming,
                    Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of encapsulation,
                    in a company there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the
                    financial transactions and keep records of all the data related to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related activities and
                    keep records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from finance section needs all the data about
                    sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of sales section. He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of sales section and
                    the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name "sales section".
                </p>
                <p>Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example the data of any of the
                    section like sales, finance or accounts is hidden from any other section.
                    In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.
